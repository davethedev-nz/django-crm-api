# Development Workflow Guide

## Branch Strategy

This project uses a two-branch workflow for safe development and automated deployment:

- **`develop`** - Feature development branch (safe for experimentation)
- **`main`** - Production branch (auto-deploys to Railway)

## Daily Development Workflow

### 1. Start Working on Features

```bash
# Make sure you're on develop branch
git checkout develop

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin develop
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Edit files
- Add new features
- Fix bugs
- Test locally

### 3. Auto-Commit Changes (Develop Branch)

Use the auto-commit script to quickly commit and push to develop:

```bash
# Auto-commit with generated message
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh

# Or provide custom message
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh "Add user authentication feature"
```

**What this does:**
- ‚úÖ Ensures you're on develop branch
- üì¶ Stages all changes
- üíæ Commits with timestamp or custom message
- üöÄ Pushes to origin/develop
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Does NOT trigger production deployment

### 4. Deploy to Production

When you're ready to deploy your changes to production:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_to_production.sh
```

**What this does:**
1. Updates develop branch from remote
2. Switches to main branch
3. Merges develop into main
4. Pushes to main (triggers Railway auto-deploy)
5. Returns you to develop branch

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose | Auto-Deploy? |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh` | Commit & push to develop | ‚ùå No |
| `./scripts/deploy_to_production.sh` | Deploy to production | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `git push origin main` | Manual deploy trigger | ‚úÖ Yes |

## Safety Features

### Develop Branch Safety
- ‚úÖ Experiment freely - no production impact
- ‚úÖ Multiple commits without deployment
- ‚úÖ Easy rollback if needed
- ‚úÖ Review changes before production

### Production Protection
- ‚úÖ Only main branch deploys to Railway
- ‚úÖ Explicit merge required (via script)
- ‚úÖ CI/CD tests run before deploy
- ‚úÖ Automatic health checks on Railway

## Example Workflows

### Scenario 1: Quick Feature Development

```bash
# Switch to develop
git checkout develop

# Make changes
nano crm_project/settings.py

# Auto-commit
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh "Update settings"

# Continue working...
nano contacts/models.py

# Another auto-commit
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh "Add contact validation"

# Deploy when ready
./scripts/deploy_to_production.sh
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Features Before Deploy

```bash
# Work on feature 1
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh "Feature 1: Add email field"

# Work on feature 2
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh "Feature 2: Add phone validation"

# Work on feature 3
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh "Feature 3: Update API docs"

# Deploy all features at once
./scripts/deploy_to_production.sh
```

### Scenario 3: Emergency Hotfix

```bash
# Switch directly to main for urgent fixes
git checkout main

# Make the fix
nano crm_project/settings.py

# Commit and push (deploys immediately)
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: Fix critical security issue"
git push origin main

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
```

## Auto-Commit Script Details

### Basic Usage

```bash
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh
```

Generates message like:
```
Auto-commit: 3 file(s) updated at 2024-01-15 14:30:00
```

### Custom Message

```bash
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh "Add user authentication"
```

Uses your custom message instead of auto-generated one.

### What It Checks

1. ‚úÖ Current branch (switches to develop if needed)
2. ‚úÖ Uncommitted changes (exits if none)
3. ‚úÖ Stages all changes (git add -A)
4. ‚úÖ Commits with message
5. ‚úÖ Pushes to origin/develop

## CI/CD Pipeline

### On Push to Develop
- ‚ùå No deployment triggered
- ‚úÖ Code is safely committed
- ‚úÖ Available for testing

### On Push to Main
1. ‚úÖ GitHub Actions runs tests
2. ‚úÖ Railway detects push
3. ‚úÖ Railway builds Docker image
4. ‚úÖ Railway runs database migrations
5. ‚úÖ Railway deploys new version
6. ‚úÖ Health checks verify deployment

## Monitoring and Logs

### Check Deployment Status

```bash
# Railway dashboard
railway open

# View logs
railway logs

# Check running services
railway status
```

### Check Application Health

```bash
# Health check endpoint
curl https://django-crm-api-production.up.railway.app/health

# Admin panel
https://django-crm-api-production.up.railway.app/admin

# API root
https://django-crm-api-production.up.railway.app/api/
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Not on develop branch" Warning

The auto-commit script will automatically switch you to develop if needed.

### Push Rejected

```bash
# Pull latest changes first
git pull origin develop

# Then try auto-commit again
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh
```

### Deployment Failed

```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Check GitHub Actions
# Go to: https://github.com/yourusername/django-crm-api/actions

# Rollback if needed
git checkout main
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Merge Conflicts

```bash
# When merging develop to main
git checkout main
git merge develop

# If conflicts occur
git status  # See conflicted files
# Edit and resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit
git push origin main
```

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO

- Use develop for all feature development
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Test locally before deploying to production
- Use auto-commit script for quick iterations
- Deploy to production when features are complete

### ‚ùå DON'T

- Don't push directly to main (except emergencies)
- Don't skip testing before production deploy
- Don't leave develop branch uncommitted for days
- Don't deploy untested code

## Environment Variables

Both branches use the same Railway environment:

- **SECRET_KEY** - Django secret key
- **DEBUG** - Set to False in production
- **ALLOWED_HOSTS** - Your Railway domain
- **DATABASE_URL** - PostgreSQL connection string

Update via Railway CLI:

```bash
railway variables --set KEY=value
```

## Summary

üéØ **Key Takeaway**: Use `develop` for safe feature development with auto-commit, and `deploy_to_production.sh` to deploy to main when ready.

```bash
# Daily workflow
git checkout develop                           # Work on develop
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh "My changes" # Commit frequently
./scripts/deploy_to_production.sh             # Deploy when ready
```

Happy coding! üöÄ
