## Database Relationship

```python
class Contact(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    phone = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True, null=True)
    position = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)
    company = models.ForeignKey(
        'companies.Company',
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
        null=True,
        blank=True,
        related_name='contacts'  # Allows company.contacts.all()
    )
    notes = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

**Relationship**: One company can have many contacts (One-to-Many)

## URL Structure

                                        â†“
                                  Contact Detail

**Commit Message**: "Implement full contact CRUD UI with company relationships"

**Changes**:

- Updated 2 existing templates
- Modified views.py with contact CRUD operations
- Updated base.html to remove nav icons

**Files Changed**:

## Next Steps

1. Test deployment on Railway development environment
2. Verify all contact operations work correctly
3. Test company-contact relationships
4. Check mobile responsiveness
5. Deploy to production if all tests pass
6. Consider adding:
   - Contact import/export
   - Contact tags or categories

   - Contact merge functionality

## Notes

- All contact operations require authentication
- Email addresses must be unique across all contacts
- Deleting a company sets contacts' company field to NULL (not cascade delete)
- Contact list uses server-side search/filter (not AJAX)
- Uses Django's built-in form handling (not DRF serializers in views)
