## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

**Database Connection Refused**:
The Django app cannot connect to the Postgres database. Error:
```
connection to server at "postgres.railway.internal" port 5432 failed: Connection refused
```

## üîß Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Check Postgres Service Status (Railway Web UI)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open project "New-app"
3. Check if "Postgres-eaN4" service is **Active** and **Deployed**
4. If it's not running, click on it and click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Verify Private Networking
1. Click on "Postgres-eaN4" service
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Ensure "Enable Private Networking" is checked
4. Do the same for "django-crm-api" service

### Option 3: Delete Old Postgres Service
There are two Postgres services in the project:
- "Postgres" (old)
- "Postgres-eaN4" (new)

If "Postgres" is not being used, delete it to avoid confusion.

### Option 4: Test Database Connection
Once the Postgres service is confirmed running, you can:
1. Redeploy the Django service: `railway up --detach`
2. Check logs: `railway logs`
3. Look for "Migrations complete!" message

## üìù Deployment Commands

```bash
# Check current service
railway status

# Switch to Django service
railway service
# Select: django-crm-api

# Deploy changes
railway up --detach

# Check logs
railway logs

# Open app in browser
railway open

# Check variables
railway variables
```

## üåê Application URLs

- **Production URL**: https://django-crm-api-production.up.railway.app
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/` - API root
  - `/api/contacts/` - Contacts API
  - `/api/companies/` - Companies API
  - `/api/deals/` - Deals API
  - `/admin/` - Django admin (after migrations)

## üéØ Expected Final State

Once the Postgres connection is fixed, the deployment should show:
```
Waiting for postgres...
Postgres is ready!
Running database migrations...
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contacts, companies, deals, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying... [migrations will run]
Migrations complete!
Starting gunicorn on port 8080
[INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
[INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

Then the API will be fully functional!
