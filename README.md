- **django-cors-headers 4.5.0** - CORS support
- **SQLite** - Default database (can be changed to PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

## Development Workflow

### Quick Start for Development

```bash
# Work on develop branch (safe for experimentation)
git checkout develop

# Option 1: Quick auto-commit
./scripts/auto_commit_develop.sh "Description of changes"

# Option 2: AI-powered pipeline (tests + commit + iterate)
./scripts/ai_pipeline.sh

# Deploy to production when ready (manual merge to main)
./scripts/deploy_to_production.sh
```

### Branch Strategy

- **develop** - Feature development (auto-deploys to Railway DEVELOPMENT)
- **main** - Production (auto-deploys to Railway PRODUCTION)

**ðŸ“– See [guides/DEVELOP_WORKFLOW.md](./guides/DEVELOP_WORKFLOW.md) for complete workflow guide**
